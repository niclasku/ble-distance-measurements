# Test of Covid-19 Bluetooth LE localization precision
This repository contains raw measurement data and a measurement report that were created during a student project.

## Introduction
The goal of the [DCAITI](https://www.dcaiti.tu-berlin.de/) student project *Test of Covid-19 Bluetooth LE 
localization precision* at TU Berlin is to measure and evaluate how and how precise Bluetooth distance estimation works 
in real world scenarios. Our first measurements have shown that both, transmitting and receiving smartphone models 
influence the measured RSSI value and therefore the calculated distance between them. As this might be interesting 
for the development of contact tracing apps, we want to share this report and the underlying data.
